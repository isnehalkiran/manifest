Getting Started
---------------

To get started with CAF, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the AI-OpenSource trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/isnehalkiran/manifest.git -b caf

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
